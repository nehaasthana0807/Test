# Introduction to Natural Langugage Processing

Considering the vast amount of unstructured text data that is constantly generated (eg, social media channels like Facebook, Twitter, forums like Quora, Reddit, various blogs, news platforms), NLP has become the crux to process, analyze and understand this large amount of text data. Almost all technology we use daily has underlying NLP use-cases like speech-to-text, machine translation, image captioning and so on.

Join us for a 6-part technical series introducing Natural Language Processing and how it can be used in solving various industry problems! We will look into the logic behind various NLP tasks and learn to implement them in Python.
